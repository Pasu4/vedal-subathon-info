# Vedal Subathon Info

## About

This repository contains information about the subathons (and possibly other streams) of the streamer [vedal987](https://twitch.tv/vedal987).
Timestamps are based on the unofficial VOD archive on YouTube by [Neuro Archiver](https://www.youtube.com/@NArchiver).
Information in this repository currently includes:

- Timestamps for the ongoing 2025 subathon
- Content overview (i.e. what happened on what day) for the ongoing 2025 subathon
- Subgoals for the ongoing 2025 subathon

I ([Pasu4](https://github.com/Pasu4)) plan to add the following in the future likely once the subathon is finished:

- Screen time for stream participants
- Content overview and partial timestamps for the 2024 subathon
- Subathon content overview

Also thanks to [@KTrain5169](https://github.com/KTrain5169) for helping out with the repo.

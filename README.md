# Vedal Subathon Info

## About

This repository contains information about the subathons (and possibly other streams) of the streamer [vedal987](https://twitch.tv/vedal987).
Timestamps are based on the unofficial VOD archive on YouTube by [Neuro Archiver](https://youtube.com/@NArchiver).
Information in this repository currently includes:

- Timestamps for the ongoing 2025 subathon
- Content overview (i.e. what happened on what day) for the ongoing 2025 subathon
- Subgoals for the ongoing 2025 subathon

I ([@Pasu4](https://github.com/Pasu4)) plan to add the following in the future once the subathon is finished, if I have the time:

- Content overview, sub goals and partial timestamps for the 2024 subathon
- Screen time for stream participants
- Graph showing timer value and subs over time
    - Probably one data point per hour, with higher resolution and/or separate graph for the Hype Train records
- Graphical timeline

Also thanks to [@KTrain5169](https://github.com/KTrain5169) for helping out with the repo.
